## Lifting State Up

Ofter, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. Let's see how this works in action.

```js
// A temperature calculator that calculates whether the water would boil at a given temperature.
function BoilingVerdict(props) { // Accepts the `celsius` temperature as a prop.
    if (props.celsius >= 100) {
        return <p>The water would boil.</p>;
    }
    return <p>The water would not boil.</p>;
}
```

Next, we will create a component called `Calculator`. It renders an `<input>` that lets you enter the temperature, and keeps its value in `this.state.temperature`.

Additionally, it renders the `BoilingVerdict` for the current input value.

```js
class Calculator extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
        this.state = {temperature: ''};
    }

    handleChange(e) {
        this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
    }

    render() {
        const temperature = this.state.temperature;
        return (
            <fieldset>
                <legend>
                    Enter temperature in Celsius:
                </legend>
                <input
                    value={temperature}
                    onChange={this.handleChange}
                />
                <BoilingVerdict
                    celsius={parseFloat(temperature)}
                />
            </fieldset>
        );
    }
}
```

### Adding a Second Input

Our new requirement is that, in addition to a Celsius input, we provide a Fahrenheit input, and they are kept in sync.

We can start by extracting a `TemperatureInput` component from `Calculator`. We will add a new scale prop to it that can either be `c` or `f`:

```js
const scaleNames = {
    c: 'Celsius',
    f: 'Fahrenheit'
};

class TemperatureInput extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
        this.state = {temperature: ''};
    }

    handleChange(e) {
        this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
    }

    render() {
        const temperature = this.state.temperature;
        const scale = this.props.scale;
        return (
            <fieldset>
                <legend>
                    Enter temperature in {scaleNames[scale]}:
                </legend>
                <input
                    value={temperature}
                    onChange={this.handleChange}
                />
            </fieldset>
        )
    }
}
```

We can new change the `Calculator` to render two separate temperature inputs:

```js
class Calculator extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <TemperatureInput scale="c" />
                <TemperatureInput scale="f" />
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

We have two inputs new, but when you enter the temperature in one of them, the other doesn't update. This contradicts our requirement: we want to keep them in sync.

We also can't display the `BoilingVerdict` from `Calculator`. The `Calculator` doesn't know the current temperature because it is hidden inside the `TemperatureInput`.

---

### Writing Conversion Functions

First, we will write two functions to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and back:

```js
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
    return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
}

function toFahrenheit(celsius) {
    return (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
}
```

These two functions convert numbers. We will write another function that takes a string `temperature` and a converter function as arguments and returns a string. We will use it to calculate the value of one input based on the other input.

It returns an empty string on an invalid `temperature`, and it keeps the output rounded to the third decimal place:

```js
function tryConvert(temperature, convert) {
    const input = parseFloat(temperature);
    if (Number.isNaN(input)) {
        return '';
    }
    const output = convert(input);
    const rounded = Math.round(output * 1000) / 1000;
    return rounded.toString();
}
```

For example. tryConvert('abc', toCelsius) returns an empty string, and tryConvert('10.22', toFahrenheit) returns `50.396`.

### Lifting State Up

Currently, both `TemperatureInput` components independently keep their values in the local state:

```js
class TemperatureInput extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
        this.state = {temperature: ''};
    }

    handleChange(e) {
        this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
    }

    render() {
        const temperature = this.state.temperature;
        // ......
    }
}
```

However, we want these two inputs to be in sync with each other. When we update the Celsius input, the Fahrenheit input should reflect the converted temperature, and vice versa.

In React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called "lifting state up". We will remove the local state from the `TemperatureInput` and move it into the `Calculator` instead.

If the `Calculator` owns the shared state, it becomes the "source of truth" for the current temperature in both inputs. It can instruct them both to have values that are consistent with each other. Since the props of both `TemperatureInput` components are coming from the same parent `Calculator` component, the two inputs will always be in sync.

Let's see how this works step by step.

First, we will replace `this.state.temperature` with `this.props.temperature` in the `TemperatureInput` component. For now, let's pretend `this.props.temperature` already exists, although we will need to pass it from the `Calculator` in the future:

```js
  render() {
    // Before: const temperature = this.state.temperature;
    const temperature = this.props.temperature;
    // .....
```

We know that props are read-only. When the `temperature` was in the local state, the `TemperatureInput` could just call `this.setState()` to change it. However, now that the `temperature` is coming from the parent as a prop, the `TemperatureInput` has no control over it.

In React, this is usually solved by making a component "controlled". Just like the DOM `<input>` accepts both a `value` and an `onChange` prop, so can the custom `TemperatureInput` accept both `temperature` and `onTemperatureChange` props from its parent `Calculator`.

Now, when the `TemperatureInput` wants to update its temperature, it calls `this.props.onTemperatureChange`:

```js
handleChange(e) {
    // Before: this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
    this.props.onTemperatureChange(e.target.value);
    // .....
}
```

> Note: there is no special meaning to either temperature or onTemperatureChange props names in custom components. We could have called them anything else, like name them value and onChange which is a common convertion.

The `onTemperatureChange` prop will be provided together with the `temperature` prop by the parent `Calculator` component. It will handle the chagne by modifying its own local state, thus re-rendering both inputs with the new values. We will look at the new `Calculator` implementation very soon.

Before diving into the changes in tha `Calculator`, let's recap our changes to the `TemperatureInput` component. We have removed the local state from it, and instead of reading `this.state.temperature`, we now read `this.props.temperature`. Instead of calling `this.setState()` when we want to make a change, we now call `this.props.onTemperatureChange()`, which will be provided by the `Calculator`:

```js
class TemperatureInput extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    }

    handleChange(e) {
        this.props.onTemperatureChange(e.target.value);
    }

    render() {
        const temperature = this.props.temperature;
        const scale = this.props.scale;
        return (
            <fieldset>
                <legend>
                    Enter temperature in {scaleNames[scale]}:
                </legend>
                <input
                    value={temperature}
                    onChange={this.handleChange}
                />
            </fieldset>
        )
    }
}
```
